### What's Lexical Specificity?
Lexical specificity [Lafon, 1980](https://www.persee.fr/doc/mots_0243-6450_1980_num_1_1_1008) is the score based on the hypergeometric distribution over
word frequencies, that measures specificity of the term in a given sub-corpus of a reference corpus. The complexity of calculating the lexical specificity can be reduced with the approximation used in 
[Camacho-Collados et al. 2016](http://josecamachocollados.com/papers/NASARI_AIJ.pdf) that is used in LexSpec and LexRank algorithms too.
